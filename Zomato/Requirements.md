# Project Requirements

## Criteria for Decomposition:
- Should include a detailed and structured research plan. What questions do you want to answer with your dashboard? What hypotheses do you have? What visualizations will be used? How do you need to work with data prior assembling the dashboard?   
- All steps in the plan should relate to your research area.    
- The plan should give your team leader a clear picture of what will be presented in the dashboard and report.   

## Criteria for the Dashboard:
- There are no limitations for the dashboard—except one: it has to be relevant to your research area.   
- Use either Tableau Public or Power BI to create the dashboard.   
- The dashboard should tell a story and every visualization should be a part of this story.

## Criteria for Report:
- Provide your findings from working with the data and creating a dashboard in the format of a report.
- The report must include your conclusions and recommendations to the business, as it’s the main goal of any analysis.
- The report must be a pdf or a presentation.
